# crime-pathfinder

# The purpose of this app is to put those who are concerned of a specific crime at an ease of mind. By using both police data and collecting cummunity data the user can see where the crime they are concerend about is most prevelent. In specific, we are focusing on sexual assult and giving users the power of control by inputing their destination and giving them areas to avoid or be most converned about. Other information that may be useful to users is where to be careful of muggings, where to avoid parking you car due to recent carjackings, where to avoid buying a house due to many house breakings and many more. Our hope with this project is to empower the user to have control over their safety.
